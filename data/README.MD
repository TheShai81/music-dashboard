# Data Folder

This project uses the Kaggle "Spotify Datasets" (artists + tracks).

1. Download from Kaggle: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lehaknarnauli/spotify-datasets?select=tracks.csv>
2. Place the following files into this folder:
   - `artists.csv`
   - `tracks.csv`

These files are intentionally **not** committed to the repo because of size limits and to keep the repository lightweight.
